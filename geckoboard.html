            <h2>Project background</h2>
            <p>At Geckoboard I'm involved with all things impacting the user experience. I work closely with software teams, conduct user research, inform product strategy, design prototypes, and help spread empathy for users. This project focuses on improving the set up experience for first time users and making it easier for new users to get started and create useful dashboards.</p>

                <figcaption>Data dashboards help monitor performance, but getting one set up can be a hard task.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>The challenge:<br>
            Make it easier to set-up a data dashboard.</h2>

            <p>Like many online software products Geckoboard offers a free 30 day trial. A small portion of trialists end up purchasing Geckoboard at the end of their trial, but most trialists don’t. This highlights a key opportunity to improve. New customers have a big impact on revenue. But if people aren't successful with a product they won’t buy it. So the first time setting up Geckoboard is an essential experience to get right.</p>


            <h2>Mapping out the existing flow</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/gecko-userflow.png" alt="image">
                <figcaption>Looking at usage statistics we saw many trialists stopped using the product shortly after sign up. They had failed to connect any data, failed to create a dashboard, and sadly never got to experience their own data displayed on a dashboard.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>Observing first-time users</h2>

            <p>To better understand the problem I lead a series of user tests. Recruiting people that fit our target audience but had never used Geckoboard before. Participants were asked about their needs and then tasked with using Geckoboard to set up a dashboard. This was an open-ended task that highlighted the experience of people using Geckoboard for the first time.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/gecko-usertesting.jpg" alt="image">
                <figcaption>Everyone in the company was invited to observe user tests, discuss what they saw, and identify common themes. The process gave the team a much better understanding of what to improve by empathising with real world users and situations.</figcaption>
            </figure>


            <h2>Themes from user testing</h2>


            <div class="principles-wrapper">

                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>It takes too long to create a dashboard.</h3>
                    <p>After half an hour of using the product most participants had connected data, added widgets. But no one had produced a dashboard that they were ready to share or display on a TV.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>It’s too easy to get distracted.</h3>
                    <p>The current editing flow distracts users from getting set up quickly. Users get deep into advanced editing before experiencing the basic product. New users expected widgets to go to the dashboard, but we invite them to edit them which distracts from making progress.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>People are concerned about data privacy.</h3>
                    <p>Many users had worries about giving access to their data. They wanted some reassurance about data privacy when connecting to a data source.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>Starting on the integrations page is confusing.</h3>
                    <p>The current experience of dumping new users on the integrations page is confusing. People that navigated to the blank dashboard first had a much better context.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>Adding multiple widgets is tedious.</h3>
                    <p>The widget-by-widget nature of building a dashboard makes the process of going from nothing to something feel tedious - especially if making lots of changes along the way. Just to add one widget the user has to go to the integrations page > then to the presets panel > then to the config screen > then to the dashboard.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>Participants failed to share their dashboard.</h3>
                    <p>The interface does not encourage users to display their dashboard on a TV. When participants were prompted to do this some end up confused by the language and the steps required. </p>
                </div>

            <h2>Improvement 1:<br>Starting with a template</h2>

            <h2>Improvement 2:<br>Reassuring users when they connecting data</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/gecko-connect.png" alt="image">
                <figcaption>User testing highlighted concerns with data security at the point of connecting to third party services. Small wording changes were enough to reassure customers and remove another point of friction.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>Improvement 3:<br>Edit directly on the dashboard</h2>

            <figure>

            <h2>Continuing to improve...</h2>

            <p>Simplifying the set-up for new users helps to improve the entire product. The first-use experience is now a continual focus at Geckoboard. Reaping benefits for both new and loyal customers as we continue to make things easier. </p>
